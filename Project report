1. Introduction
This project report offers a comprehensive insight into the design and development of a Contact Manager application using Python. The application aims to provide users with a versatile and efficient tool for organizing and managing their contacts effectively.

 2. Project Description
The Contact Manager is a command-line-based application with a wide array of functionalities, including but not limited to:
- Adding new contacts with extensive details.
- Editing and updating contact information.
- Deleting contacts from the contact list.
- Efficient searching and filtering of contacts based on user-defined criteria.
- Viewing, sorting, and managing contact information.

 3. Features and Functionality
The Contact Manager project boasts the following prominent features:
- Contact Management: The ability to add, edit, and delete contacts with a range of fields, ensuring thorough contact details are maintained.
- Search and Filter: A robust search and filter mechanism, allowing users to find contacts quickly based on different attributes such as name, phone number, or email.
- User Interaction: A user-friendly command-line interface, guiding users through various operations and ensuring a smooth user experience.
- Data Storage: The application securely stores contact data using SQLite, guaranteeing data integrity and accessibility.

 4. Technologies and Tools
- Programming Language: Python was chosen for its versatility and ease of use.
- Data Storage: SQLite, a lightweight and efficient relational database management system, was employed for local data storage.

5. Project Architecture
The project architecture adheres to a modular design, with distinct components responsible for various functionalities. SQLite is employed as the local data storage mechanism, ensuring efficient and reliable data management. The application is designed for command-line execution, offering users a straightforward interface.

 6. Implementation Details
The application is implemented as a Python script, featuring a range of functions for adding, editing, deleting, and searching for contacts. SQLite is used as the underlying database system, ensuring data consistency and reliability. The Python script interacts with the database to provide a seamless user experience.

 7. User Guide
- Application Launch: To initiate the Contact Manager, execute the Python script.
- Operations: Utilize the menu options and prompts to perform operations such as adding, editing, deleting, or searching for contacts.
- Instructions: Follow the on-screen instructions and prompts for each operation to ensure a hassle-free experience.

 8. Challenges Faced and Solutions
Throughout the project, several challenges were encountered and successfully addressed:
- Database Management: Managing data storage and retrieval with SQLite was complex but ultimately resolved for data accuracy.
- Data Security: Ensuring data security and integrity was a priority, and comprehensive measures were put in place.

9. Conclusion and Achievements
The Contact Manager project stands as a successful implementation of a command-line application for efficient contact management. It serves as a practical and effective solution, empowering users to efficiently organize and maintain their contact information. This achievement demonstrates the potential of Python as a versatile tool for developing command-line applications.

10. Future Enhancements
